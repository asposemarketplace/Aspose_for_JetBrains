  <description><![CDATA[
     <b>Aspose Application</b> creates a new IntelliJ project by downloading and referencing libraries of <b>Aspose Java APIs</b>.
        <br/><br/>
        Aspose Project Wizard allows you to select API(s) from Aspose Java product lines like Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Words for Java etc.<br/><br/>
        Once specific API is selected, its reference is automatically downloaded from Aspose servers and referenced in classpath of the project.<br/><br/>
        New created project is ready to debug/evaluate, all references are automatically added.
        <br/><br/>
        With this plugin, you never need to check for new releases of Aspose APIs. Whenever a new release is published, you will be notified while creating new project and you can also check release notes to save your time.
